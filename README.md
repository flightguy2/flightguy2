- 👋 Hi, I’m @flightguy2
- 👀 I’m interested in OpenPilot on Comma 3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to add a new vehicle for the Comma 3 - A 2019 Lexus NX300.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hopefully just fingerprinting, using the established 2018 model and fingerprinting for 2019.
- 📫 How to reach me - IM me here.
